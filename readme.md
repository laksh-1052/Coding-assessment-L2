Hello recuiter!
I have completed almost all the tasks assigned except extracting data from api, i was getting some major errors related to CORS I even tested if it was functional using Postman it was, unfortunately I could not get only this part.

I did this within few hours as I had my internals going on, please appreciate the effort I have put and trust me, with the right team and documentation I will be 100% helpful.

A brief description about this project :
   --> A shopping website showcasing clothes for men, women and kids
   --> Included with price details, brand and discount details.
   --> resposive website as we can switch between tabs.

BONUS POINTS!!!!
I have hosted this cute website on my github! 

Thankyou so much for this opportunity I had fun doing this assignment, hope you select me <3
